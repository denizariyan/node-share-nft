# DISCLAIMER
This is a proof of concept project which I have deployed ONLY on test net, this was my early process of learning NFT contracts. If it gives you an idea feel free to scavange parts of it but I suggest you not to directly copy-paste and deploy this for a real world use case. There is multiple points where this contract can be abused but I do not intend to solve these at this point of time to focus my time on other projects.

Feel free to open an issue to ask about anything, would be happy to assist where I can.

## node-share-nft
WIP. NFT project that supports different types, URIs and multi-minting for a revenue share model NFT project.
